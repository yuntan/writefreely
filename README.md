WriteFreely is a beautifully pared-down blogging platform that's simple on the surface, yet powerful underneath.

It's designed to be flexible and share your writing widely, so it's built around plain text and can publish to the _fediverse_ via ActivityPub. It's easy to install and light enough to run on a Raspberry Pi.

## Hosting

We offer two kinds of hosting services that make WriteFreely deployment painless: [Write.as](https://write.as) for individuals, and [WriteFreely.host](https://writefreely.host) for communities. Besides saving you time, as a customer you directly help fund WriteFreely development.

### [![Write.as](https://write.as/img/writeas-wf-readme.png)](https://write.as/)

Start a personal blog on [Write.as](https://write.as), our flagship instance. Built to eliminate setup friction and preserve your privacy, Write.as helps you start a blog in seconds. It supports custom domains (with SSL) and multiple blogs / pen names per account. [Read more here](https://write.as/pricing).

### [![WriteFreely.host](https://writefreely.host/img/wfhost-wf-readme.png)](https://writefreely.host)

[WriteFreely.host](https://writefreely.host) makes it easy to start a close-knit community — to share knowledge, complement your Mastodon instance, or publish updates in your organization. We take care of the hosting, upgrades, backups, and maintenance so you can focus on writing.

## Quick start

WriteFreely has minimal requirements to get up and running — you only need to be able to run an executable.
